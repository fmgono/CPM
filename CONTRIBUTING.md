## Get involved

There are many ways to contribute to CPM, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here are a few ideas to get started:

- Look through the [CPM issues](<(https://github.com/fmgono/CPM)/issues>). If you find an issue you would like to fix, [open a pull request](#first-pull-request).
- Help us make the docs better. File an issue if you find anything that is confusing, any grammatical error, or can be improved.
- Take a look at [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fmgono/CPM/discussions) and give your opinion into a discussion or consider opening a pull request if you see something you want to work on.

Contributions are very welcome!

## Our development process

CPM uses [GitHub](https://github.com/fmgono/CPM) as its source of truth. All changes will be public from the beginning.

### Reporting new issues/bugs. {#issues}

When [opening a new issue](<[https://github.com/kimlimjustin/xplorer/issues](https://github.com/fmgono/CPM)/issues>)), always make sure to fill out the issue template. We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

- _One issue, one bug_: Please report a single bug per issue.
- _Provide reproduction steps_: List all the steps necessary to reproduce the issue. The person reading your bug report should be able to follow these steps to reproduce your issue with minimal effort.

##@ Feature Request {#feat}

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fmgono/CPM/discussions) and [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/fmgono/CPM/issues) to track ideas from users. Suggest a new feature [here](https://github.com/fmgono/CPM/discussions/new)!
Great Feature Requests tend to have:

- A quick idea summary.
- What & why do you want to add the specific feature?
- Additional references like images, links to resources about the feature, etc.

## Ready to contribute a Pull Request (PR)?

### Semantic commit messages {#commit-msg}

See how a minor change to your commit message style can make you a better programmer.

^--^  ^------------^
|     |

```

the various types of commits:

- `feat`: new feature for the user

- `docs`: changes to the documentation
- `style`: formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.
- `refactor`: refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable
