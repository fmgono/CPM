# What is CPM

CPM stands for "Code Project Manager". It is a simple, cross-platform app that shows all the projects the dev has on their machine without the need to browse each directory by themselves, tells how much storage space is used for each project, and can also delete the dependencies to free space (by removing the node_modules folder for example).

## Features
These are the features that we want to build:
1. List all the code projects on our disk without the need to browse each directory by ourselves.
2. Ability to easily remove the projects or the dependencies for old projects to free some space.
3. Ability to overview the project pieces of information such as:
    1. The size of the project
    2. Creation date
    3. Last Modified date
    4. Git information (if any):
        1. Unstaged files
        2. Staged files
        3. Unpushed commit
